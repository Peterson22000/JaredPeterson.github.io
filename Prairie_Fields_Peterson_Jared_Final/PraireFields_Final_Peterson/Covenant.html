                        Are there any rules or regulations which apply to my property?
                        Prairie Fields is regulated by covenants.   There are different covenants for each phase of the Prairie Fields development. Each set of covenants includes a map, showing the location of the properties which that set of covenants applies.  Also on the website is the Prairie Fields Homeowners Association Bylaws, adopted in 2008.
                        
                        How is the HOA going to enforce covenants?
                        Actually, your covenants list covenant enforcement as the responsibility of a developer related committee.  The Board of Directors is working to change enforcement so that it is controlled by the Homeowners Association, and a committee will ultimately establish enforcement procedures.
                        
                        What is covenant consolidation?
                        Because each phase of the subdivision has different covenants, the Board of Directors has a committee evaluating consolidating the different covenants into one set which would apply to all homes in PF.  The consolidated covenants would have to be approved by 75% of the residents of each phase of PF, which wonâ€™t be easy.  Email board@prairiefieldshoa.com to volunteer for the Covenant Consolidation Committee.
